# Bagging-and-AdaBoost
Implementation of Bagging and AdaBoost Algorithm

* Dataset
  * Red Wine Quality Data Sets
  * For simplicity, we will have 2 classes of wine instead of 3 classes by merging the ”good/2” and the ”normal/1” class as one. The samples are labeled as: ”good/1” (QS>=6) and ”bad/0” (QS<6). Then, we partition the data set into a training set and a testing set including 1000 samples and 599 samples respectively.
